# Band Pass Filter Simulation

Here you find the BPF Simulation files for 40m (7Mhz), 20m (14Mhz) and 15m (21Mhz).

The simulation was done on RFSim99, you can find RFSim99 easily on Google and it's very easy to use and simulate things.

Also there is the testing of the 40m and 15m Band Pass Filters for the project with MiniVNA
